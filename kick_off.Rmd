# Introduction

## Background

```{r, echo=FALSE, dpi=400, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics(path = "figures/FMC2_eng.png")
```

## Goal

- Estimating the average FMC-to-door time for 
    - each (small) area
    - national level
- Estimating the average "success probability" of FMC-to-door time $<$ 30 minutes

To provide a fundamental information for public health policy 

## Traditional statistical approaches

Statistical estimation based on probability sampling -- survey sample based

- Pros
    - Study method is well estabilished
- Cons
    - Costly to collect the data
    - Difficult to produce the statistics in a fine resolution (small areas)
    
## Our approach
Automated methods to collect the data from simulation -- hybrid of traditional data and "modern" data

- Pros
    - Can collect much larger, more detailed data with very low cost
    - Can produce small area statistics 
- Cons
    - Need more assumptions on data generating process

## Data description

- Hospital statistics (70-80 % coverage (? unclear; needs more clarification))
- Statistics Korea Census data (census block demographic population) 
- Heart attack patients statistics (2016)
- Nationwide emergency paramedic network (spatial locations)
- Statistics of hospitals conducting interventional cardiology procedure (spatial locations)

## Main idea
For each census block

- Estimating the average number of patients 
- Estimating average FMC-to-door time


Estimate the average FMC-to-door time for larger area using the
estimated average number of patients as weight
\[
T = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{K} M_{i} T_{i}}{ \sum_{i=1}^{K} M_{i} },
\] 
where 

- $i$: census block index 
- $M_{i}$: expected number of patients for the $i$ th census block 
- $T_{i}$: expected FMC-to-door time for the $i$ th census block 

## Statistics Korea Census block population statistics

- Five-year old interval for male/female 
- The numbers are masked when the count is less than five for confidentiality
- Census block is divided by the (not-easily-changing) large road and facilities for consistency
- Much smaller area than the smallest administrative areal unit; urban areas tend to have smaller blocks while rural areas tend to have larger blocks. 
- Total of 102,024 blocks (as of 2016).

## An example in Seoul

```{r, echo=FALSE, dpi=400, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics(path = "figures/sajikdong.png")
```
Census block is depicted by red lines.

# Estimation

## Two components in estimation

- The expected number of patients for each block: Estimation using hospital statistics and demographic statistics
- The expected FMC-to-door time: Estimation using online map API simulated query results


## Estimating the expected number of patients for each block 

- Demographic information + hospital statistics + patients statistics (administrative data)
- Idea
    - Estimate the patients' distribution using hospital statistics (age/sex)
    - Estimate the patients' distribution for each region 
    - Estimate the patients' distribution for each census block using census block statistics 

## Notation 

- $N_{ij}$: population in $i$th block, $j$th demographic feature (Known)
- $M_{ij}$: number of patients in $i$th block, $j$th demographic feature (Unknown)
- $M_{+j}=\sum_{i=1}^K M_{ij}$: number of patients with $j$th demographic feature
- $M = \sum_{j=1}^J M_{+j}$: total patients (Known)
- $P_{j} = M_{+j} / M_{++}$: probability that a patient belonging to $j$th demographic feature 
- $P_{i \mid j}$: conditional probability that a patient with $j$th demographic feature belongs to the $i$th block 
- $M_{i+} = \sum_{j=1}^J M_{ij}$: Patients in $i$th block (Target parameter)


## Estimating the expected number of patients for each block


- Probability distribution of patients for each demographic group: Estimate $P_{j}$ using hospital statistics 
- Conditional probability $P_{i \mid j}$: Using census data -- assuming that population and patients group have the identitcal conditional probability
- Expected patients in $i$th block:
\[ 
\hat{M}_{i+} = M \times \sum_{j=1}^J \hat{P}_{j} P_{i \mid j},
\]
where $\hat{P}_{j}$ is the estimate for $P_{j}$ (obtained from hospital statistics) and $P_{i \mid j}$ is obtained from census statistics.

\caption{Conditional probability using census statistics}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
 \hline
    & \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Sex/Age}  \\

\end{table}

- Conditional Probability : $P_{ i \mid j} =N_{i,j}/N_{+, j}$
- $\hat{M}_{ij} = M \times \hat{P}_j  \times P_{ i \mid j}$
- $\hat{M}_{i+} =  \sum_j \hat{M}_{ij}$

## Calculated Weights

```

## Estimating FMC-to-door time for each block

1. Sampling a coordinate 
1. Geocoding: a coordinate $\rightarrow$ an address
1. Using the API query results 
    - Search the nearest hospital and calculate the travel time
    - Search the nearest paramedic station and calculate the travel time
1. Combine two results

## Tools for Estimating FMC-to-door time
- An API tool called [**T Map**](http://tmapapi.sktelecom.com/main.html) was used
- Provides an Open API for various map-based services 
    - (optimal) travel route search
    - Address search
    - Point of interest (e.g., "Coffee near Seoul Station")
    - Real time traffic
    - etc

## API is convenient but **not** free
- Much cheaper than traditional approach but not free for purpose of massive data collection 
    - Network maintenence
    - Service maintenence
    - Service charge for data query is one of the most important revenue source for map service provider (e.g., Google map for Uber/Lyft)

## Challenge: Design of query experiment
Query is *constrained*

- geocoding  (coordinate - address) : 100K queries per day/ 20 queries per second
- route search (coordinate - coordinate or address - address) : 50K queries per day/ 5 queries per second
- The constraints are placed because intensive use of queries can be very demanding for the system

## Designing the query experiment

- Travel time is affected by the traffic -- weekly or diurnal pattern (more travel time during the rush hour)
- Uniformly spread the queries for each locations and time (e.g., Not "Seoul at 7PM and Pusan at 8PM"; but "Seoul at 7PM, Pusan at 7PM, ..., Seoul at 8PM, Pusan at 8PM")
- Need to consider the query constraints
- Nearest place (in distance) $\neq$ shortest travel time -- need to consider a few candidates
    - consumes more queries
- Need to exclude the "unlikely" locations (e.g., surface of a lake)

## Search process

Obtain the travel time to the nearest hospital from a given location using API

1. Randomly select a coordinate $(x, y)$ on the map  
1. Search the address from the coordiate (consumes 1 geocoding query)
    - If a valid address is returned: search the coordinate from the returned address (consumes 1 geocoding query) as the origin
    - If not (wilderness, river, lake, etc.): stop the process and select a new coordinate
1. Search two nearest hospitals from the origin
    - Query the travel time to two hospitals (consumes 2 routes queries)
    - Select the one with the shorter travel time
 
## An example (matching the nearest address)

```{r, echo=FALSE, dpi=400, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics(path = "figures/spatial_query_1.png")
```


## Another example (an unusable coordinate)

```{r, echo=FALSE, dpi=400, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics(path = "figures/spatial_query_2.png")
```

## Final query design

- 250 municipalities (equivalent of counties in US)
- 24 hours
- Initiate the query at every hour
    - Used `crontab` from linux -- automatic scheduler
    - `R` script -- command-line based execution
- Choose four points from each municipality
    - 250 (municipalities) $\times$ 4 (locations) $\times$ 2 (Two hospitals) $\times$ 24(hours) = 48000 / 50000 (Maximum query per day)
    - Remaining 2000 queries can be used for fixing the code or testing for next step
- Paramedic network is searched in the reverse direction

## Query results: patient's location $\rightarrow$ hospital

```{r, echo=FALSE, dpi=700, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics(path = "figures/raw_map_hosp.png")
```


## Query results: paramedic network $\rightarrow$ patient's location}
```{r, echo=FALSE, dpi=700, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics(path = "figures/raw_map_119.png")
```


## An example: Sajik-dong in Seoul

```{r, echo=FALSE, dpi=400, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics(path = "figures/sajikdong.png")
```

## Challenge:  Sajik-dong in Seoul

```{r, echo=FALSE, dpi=400, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics(path = "figures/sajikdong_overlaid.png")
```
- ``Big but not quite big enough'': query results more than 60K cannot provide enough information for each municipality (# of municipalities $>>$ # of queries)

## Jongro-gu (where Sajik-dong belongs to)

```{r, echo=FALSE, dpi=400, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics(path = "figures/jongrogu.png")
```
Observation

- Northern areas tend to take more -- mostly mountains 
- Southern areas tend to take shorter -- close to the downtown Seoul

## Spatial distance and travel time difference

```{r, echo=FALSE, dpi=500, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics(path = "figures/variogram.png")
```

## Spatial smoothing
```{r, echo=FALSE, dpi=400, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics(path = "figures/jongrogu-smoothed.png")
```

## Numerical Integration


- Parameter of interest
\[ 
T_i = \int_{\Omega_i} T(x) f(x) dx,
\]
where $\Omega_i$ is the collection of addresses in $i$th block, $T(x)$ is the travel time from location $x$, $f(x)$ is the probability density at $x$ 
- Simple Monte Carlo:
$$ \hat{T}_i = \frac{1}{n_i} \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} T(x_{ij}) $$
where $x_{ij} \sim f(x) , x \in \Omega_i$.
- ``Smoothed'' estimate
   $$ \hat{T}_i^* = \frac{1}{n_i^*} \sum_{j=1}^{n_i^*} \hat{T}(x_{ij}) $$
   where $\hat{T}(x)$ is the predictor of $T(x)$ from a statistical model (Used Kriging assuming a stationary Gaussian process)
